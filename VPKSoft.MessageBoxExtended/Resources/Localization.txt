This is the simple tab-delimited localization file.
As you can see only the "[]" tags and tab delimited key-value pairs matter for the localization.
The tab-delimited text can also include comments, etc. by adding a new tab-delimited field.

Use the '&' character to indicate the mnemonic character if the Alt-key is pressed within the dialog. 
NOTE: that these must be unique to work but no errors are caused if they aren't unique.
